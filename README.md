> The app violates Apples App store TOS (probably),so unless AltStore finds a way to sideload apple watch app you'll have to compile this for yourself.


Research: 

1. As of v2, the deauther seems to store data in [web interface directory](https://github.com/SpacehuhnTech/esp8266_deauther/tree/v2/web_interface)
  - 192.168.4.1/ssids.json
      - List of ssids *beacon attack seems to replicate ssids contained here*
  - 192.168.4.1/scan.json
      - List of all ssids scanned, their signal strength, security type and BSSID
  - 192.168.4.1/names.json
      - Saved Devices in Scan.html page, tapping add on scanned wifi adds the data here 
  - 192.168.4.1/attack.json
      - `[[false,0,0,0],[true,0,0,0],[false,0,0,0]]` can be translated to
      -  [[deauth = false], [Targets = 0], [pkt/s = 0/s]], [[beacon = false], [Targets = 0], [pkt/s = 0/s]], [[probe = false], [Targets = 0], [pkt/s = 0/s]]
  - [attack.js](https://github.com/SpacehuhnTech/esp8266_deauther/blob/v2/web_interface/js/attack.js#L4)
      - contains endpoints server has `run?cmd=attack`   
  - [scan.js](https://github.com/SpacehuhnTech/esp8266_deauther/blob/v2/web_interface/js/scan.js)
      ```js
     var cmdStr = "scan "
		 (type == 0 ? "aps " : "stations -t " + getE("scanTime").value + "s")
		 " -ch " + getE("ch").options[getE("ch").selectedIndex].value;
		 ```
  - [ssids.js](https://github.com/SpacehuhnTech/esp8266_deauther/blob/bbe1b24e304853b1292a6eaa84a83a1b84ac0998/web_interface/js/ssids.js)
      ```js
      //disabling random
      getFile("run?cmd=disable random", function () {
        load();
      });
      // enabling random 
        getFile("run?cmd=enable random " + getE("interval").value, function () {
          load();
        });
     ```

Currently Working Features
- [x] Scan for APs
- [x] Refresh Scanned List
- [x] Beacon Start/Stop Attack (Random) 60 
- [x] Beacon Start/Stop Attack (Custom) *custom amount*
- [x] Log View
- [x] Half Baked Add (append) SSID function.

Wishlist
- [ ] Read Values from attack.json and toggle buttons accordinly instead of depending on @State variables. 
- [ ] Complete Half Baked add (append) SSID function
- [ ] See Saved BSSID View
- [ ] Remove that refresh button, use Timer and progress view instead.
- [ ] Enhanced Log View
- [ ] Scan Stations
- [ ] Deauth Frame *pick ssid from "list"*

Maybe will add in future
- [ ] Custom pwned IP (in case it's different from 192.168.1.4) 
- [ ] Probe *might scrape this*
